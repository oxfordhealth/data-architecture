# Data Architecture and Engineering

## Purpose of this site

This site is a collection of documents that describe the data architecture and data engineering practices at OHFT. The documents are intended to be a reference for all data users within the trust.

The initial stated goals for the OHFT Data Architecture group are:

- To be clear about how we are sharing data today, from where, via what and to where
- To take informed views about additional new data flows
- To look at the vision for the ICS and think about how OHFT architecture can meet the requirements
- To agree a set of principles around data sharing and data flows
- To put a plan in place to ensure OHFT architecture is fit for purpose, adheres to our principles, can deliver the vision
